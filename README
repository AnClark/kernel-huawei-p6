# Huawei Ascend P6 kernel source

## OVERVIEW

This kernel source is forked from @surdupetru 's repository (https://github.com/surdupetru/huawei-p6), with my enhancement on configurations and some bugfixes. It's successful while building TWRP 3.0.2.0 recovery.

## HOW TO USE

Generally, this source is used for Android building. Clone this repository first, then move it into `<ANDROID_SOURCE>/kernel/huawei/hwp6_u06`. If you want to build Android or TWRP recovery, please also clone my given configuration file from `https://github.com/AnClark/twrp_device_huawei_hwp6_u06`.

## BUILD KERNEL ALONE

Also, you can build this kernel alone if you want to test the new kernel, or change your current kernel, even more. Every possibility is able to achieve by you.

### Preparation

- An x86_64 Linux system. My environment is Ubuntu 16.04.
- Build essentials. You can install via `sudo apt install build-essential` (On Ubuntu 16.04. For other distributions like RedHat, OpenSUSE please follow other instructions).
- ARM cross-compile kits. **Friendly-ARM GCC is necessary, notice that other newer kits CAN BUILD, BUT CANNOT RUN!**
